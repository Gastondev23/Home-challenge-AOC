##Challenges

String Transformation Challenge
Problem Statement
Transform a given string based on its length:

If the length is divisible by 3, reverse the string.
If the length is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
If the length is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., 15), reverse the string first, then replace each character with its ASCII code.
Examples
Input: "Hamburger"

Output: "regrubmaH"
Reason: Length is 9, divisible by 3.
Input: "Pizza"

Output: "80 105 122 122 97"
Reason: Length is 5, divisible by 5.
Input: "Chocolate Chip Cookie"

Output: "eikooCpihCetalocohC"
Reason: Length is 21, divisible by 3.
How to Use
Copy the provided code into a JavaScript file, e.g., stringTransformation.js.
Run the file using Node.js or include the function in a web-based JavaScript environment.

##Array Manipulation Challenge
Problem Statement
Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within the array that sums up to the target. Return true if such a subarray exists, otherwise return false.

Example
Input: [4, 2, 7, 1, 9, 5], target = 17

Output: true
Reason: The subarray [7, 1, 9] sums up to 17.
Constraints
The array will contain between 1 and 100,000 elements.
The elements in the array and the target sum will be between -1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000.
How to Use
Copy the provided code into a JavaScript file, e.g., arrayManipulation.js.
Run the file using Node.js or include the function in a web-based JavaScript environment.
